# AynNet
This repository contains a custom implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), designed from scratch using Python and NumPy. The project showcases a step-by-step approach to building a CNN, including the implementation of core components like convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
